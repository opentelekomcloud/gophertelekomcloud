// Monitor represents a load balancer health monitor. A health monitor is used
// to determine whether back-end members of the VIP's pool are usable
// for processing a request. A pool can have several health monitors associated
// with it. There are different types of health monitors supported:
//
// PING: used to ping the members using ICMP.
// TCP: used to connect to the members using TCP.
// HTTP: used to send an HTTP request to the member.
// HTTPS: used to send a secure HTTP request to the member.
//
// When a pool has several monitors associated with it, each member of the pool
// is monitored by all these monitors. If any monitor declares the member as
// unhealthy, then the member status is changed to INACTIVE and the member
// won't participate in its pool's load balancing. In other words, ALL monitors
// must declare the member to be healthy for it to stay ACTIVE.

	Type Type `json:"type"`

	Delay int `json:"delay"`

	// The maximum number of seconds for a monitor to wait for a connection to be
	// established before it times out. This value must be less than the delay
	// value.
	Timeout int `json:"timeout"`

	// Specifies the number of consecutive health checks when the health check result of a backend server changes
	// from OFFLINE to ONLINE.

	// The HTTP method that the monitor uses for requests.
	HTTPMethod string `json:"http_method"`

	// The HTTP path of the request sent by the monitor to test the health of a
	// member. Must be a string beginning with a forward slash (/).
